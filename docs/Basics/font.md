# Font Styling

Usually you would like to emphasize certain words or phrases in text. Bolding and italicising are some of the best ways to do so.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

### Bolded Example

I just love **bold text**.

## Italics

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

### Italicized Example

Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.
